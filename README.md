# Quantum-Notes

The project utilizes IBM Quantum Lab to generate components of traditionally notated music through superpositions. Executing the QASM generates the key, note type, and notes. The output is the syntax of the Lilypond library, which allows for musical notation. The music is generated in IBM Quantum Lab and notated using Lilypond in an external IDE.

Atlas Eclipticalis by John Cage inspired the project. Cage, to create his piece, superimposed musical staves over the star charts of the Atlas Eclipticalis  1950.0. The music is inherently random, dictated by the positions of stars in the night sky. Likewise, Quantum Notes translates the illusive superposition into a more universally understandable means of music.

The purpose of Quantum Notes is to study patterns in quantum computing operations and present them mathematically and musically. It provides a novel way to visualize and understand these patterns while bridging quantum and classical worlds. One goal is to foster interdisciplinary collaboration while providing an educational tool for teaching quantum computing concepts in a more accessible manner.
