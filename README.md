# Quantum-Notes

The project uses IBM Quantum Lab to generate the important components of traditionally notated music through superpositions. The key, note type, and notes themselves are all generated by executing the QASM simulator. The output is the syntax used by the Lilypond library, which allows for musical notation. The music is generated in IBM Quantum Lab, and is notated using Lilypond elsewhere.
